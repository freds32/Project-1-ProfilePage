        <p>I'm Fred Schlichtholz, a dynamic and driven athlete turned professional, balancing a successful career in baseball with a interest in sales and technology. Standing tall at 6'3" and weighing 250lbs, my athletic prowess is matched by my dedication to continuous improvement. With a keen focus on enhancing my speed and strength as a baseball pitcher, I'm always striving to reach new heights in my sports career.</p>
        <p>I am a proud graduate of Coronado High School (2009-2013) and went on to attend California State University of Fresno on an athletic scholarship, maintaining a solid 3.0 GPA. My commitment and talent led me to be a 2017 MLB draftee, and I have been a Minor League Player for the San Diego Padres since then.</p>
        <p>My professional journey extends beyond the baseball field. I've gained valuable experience as a Low Voltage Tech at GotUWired and have demonstrated my versatility by working as a Private Contractor in Construction during my college summers. My passion for baseball also saw me take on the role of Private Instructor, where I mentored young athletes.</p>
        <p>An active volunteer, I've contributed to various organizations, including Walk For Alzheimer's, Team Smile, Saturday Sports, O2 Breathe Walk, Big Heroes Little Heroes, and Feed The Need Food Collection/Distribution. My commitment to giving back to the community is as strong as my commitment to my personal and professional growth.</p>
        <p>Now venturing into the tech world, I'm eager to leverage my diverse skills and experiences to excel as a web developer. With a solid foundation in teamwork, leadership, and discipline from my sports career, I'm ready to tackle new challenges and begin my journey in the tech industry.</p>
        <p>I currently reside in San Diego, CA, and when I'm not on the field or working on my career, I enjoy spending time with my dogs, daily walks, days at the beach, and spending time with friends and family. I'm also delving into the world of coding, particularly front-end web design, to expand my technical skills.</p>
